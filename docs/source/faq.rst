operation or more specifically related to :term:`CWL` specification.

How to specify the Docker image reference?
==================================================

In most situations, the ``CommandLineTool`` process will need to run a :term:`Docker` image. Doing so is as simple as
adding the ``DockerRequirement`` (|cwl-docker-req-ref|_) as follows to the :ref:`Application Package` definition:

.. |cwl-docker-req-ref| replace:: reference
.. _cwl-docker-req-ref: `cwl-docker-req`_

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "cwlVersion": "v1.0",
      "requirements": {
        "DockerRequirement": {
          "dockerPull": "<docker-url>"
        }
      },
      "inputs": ["<...>"],
      "outputs": ["<...>"],
    }


.. note::
    The :term:`Docker` image reference must be publicly accessible to allow :term:`CWL` to pull it. Alternatively,
    a private :term:`Docker` reference can be used if the image is locally available. The process will fail to execute
    if it cannot resolve the reference.

The :ref:`Application Package` can be provided during process deployment.
Please refer to below references for more details.

Fixing permission error on input files
==========================================

Some processes expect their inputs to be writable (e.g.: ZIP files). When running an :term:`Application Package` based
on a :term:`Docker` image, `Weaver` mounts the input files as `volumes` in read-only mode for security reasons. This
causes these processes to immediately fail as the running user cannot override nor write temporary files in the same
directory (where the volume was mounted to), as it is marked with read permissions.

To resolve this issue, the application developer should add the ``InitialWorkDirRequirement``
(|cwl-wd-ref|_, |cwl-wd-ex|_) to his CWL package definition. This tells :term:`CWL` to stage the files into the
:term:`Docker` container into the running directory where the user will be allowed to generate outputs, and therefore,
also allow edition of the inputs or generation of temporary files as when unpacking a compressed file.

.. |cwl-wd-ref| replace:: reference
.. _cwl-wd-ref: `cwl-workdir-req`_
.. |cwl-wd-ex| replace:: example
.. _cwl-wd-ex: `cwl-workdir-ex`_

As example, the :term:`CWL` definition could be similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "cwlVersion": "v1.0",
      "class": "CommandLineTool",
      "requirements": {
        "DockerRequirement": {
          "dockerPull": "<docker-url>"
        },
        "InitialWorkDirRequirement": {
          "listing": [{
             "entry": "$(inputs.input_file)",
             "writable": true
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "arguments": ["$(runtime.outdir)"],
      "inputs": {
        "input_file": {
        "type": "File"
      }
    }

Note that ``$(inputs.input_file)`` within ``InitialWorkDirRequirement`` tells which input to resolve for staging using
the ``"writable": True`` parameter. All files listed there will be mounted with write permissions into working runtime
directory of the executed :term:`Docker` container.

Where can I find references to CWL specification and examples?
================================================================

There exist multiple sources, but official ones provided below have a create amount of examples and are being
continuously improved by the developers (including being updated according to changes).

- |cwl-guide|_
- |cwl-cmdtool|_
- |cwl-workflow|_
- See also below.


Where can I find examples of Process Deployment, Execution and Application Package definitions?
=====================================================================================================

Many examples are reported in detail in the |examples|_ chapter.


Is there an easier way to interact with `Weaver` for its multiple requests and operations?
=====================================================================================================

Yes!

Take a look at the :ref:`cli` chapter for available utilities to interact with `Weaver`
using shell or Python scripting.
