Weaver (the nest-builder)
  *Weaver birds build exquisite and elaborate nest structures that are a rival to any human feat of engineering.
  Some of these nests are the largest structures to be built by birds.*
  [`Eden <https://eden.uktv.co.uk/animals/birds/article/weaver-birds/>`_].

  *Although weavers are named for their elaborately woven nests, some are notable for their selective parasitic
  nesting habits instead.*
  [`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploceidae>`_]

`Weaver` is an OGC-API flavored |ems| that allows the execution of workflows chaining various
applications and |wps| inputs and outputs. Remote execution is deferred by the `EMS` to one or many
|ades| or remote service providers, and employs |cwl| configurations to define an |ogc-apppkg|_ deployed
for each process.

Summary
----------------

`Weaver` is primarily an |ems| that allows the execution of workflows chaining various
applications and |wps| inputs and outputs. Remote execution of each process in a workflow
chain is dispatched by the *EMS* to one or many registered |ades| by
ensuring the transfer of files accordingly between instances when located across multiple remote locations.

`Weaver` can also accomplish the `ADES` role in order to perform application deployment at the data source using
the application definition provided by |cwl| configuration. It can then directly execute
a registered process |ogc-apppkg|_ with received inputs from a WPS request to expose output results for a
following `ADES` in a `EMS` workflow execution chain.

`Weaver` **extends** |ogc-api-proc|_ by providing additional functionalities such as more detailed job logs
endpoints, adding more process management and search request options than required by the standard, and supporting
*remote providers* registration for dynamic process definitions, to name a few.
Because of this, not all features offered in `Weaver` are guaranteed to be applicable on other similarly
behaving `ADES` and/or `EMS` instances. The reference specification is tracked to preserve the minimal conformance
requirements and provide feedback to |ogc|_ (OGC) in this effect.

`Weaver` can be launched either as an `EMS`, an `ADES` or an `HYBRID` of both according to its configuration.
For more details, see `Configuration`_ and `Documentation`_ sections.

----------------
Configuration
----------------

All configuration settings can be overridden using a ``weaver.ini`` file that will be picked during
instantiation of the application. An example of such file is provided here: `weaver.ini.example`_.

Setting the operational mode of `Weaver` (`EMS`/`ADES`/`HYBRID`) is accomplished using the
``weaver.configuration`` field of ``weaver.ini``. For more configuration details, please refer to Documentation_.

.. _weaver.ini.example: ./config/weaver.ini.example

----------------
Documentation
----------------

The REST API documentation is auto-generated and served under any running `Weaver` application on route
``{WEAVER_URL}/api/``. This documentation will correspond to the version of the executed `Weaver` application.
For the latest documentation, you can refer to the `OpenAPI Specification`_ served directly on `ReadTheDocs`_.

More ample details about installation, configuration and usage are also provided on `ReadTheDocs`_.
These are generated from corresponding information provided in `docs`_ source directory.

-------------------------
Extra Details & Sponsors
-------------------------

The project was initially developed upon `OGC Testbed-14 – ESA Sponsored Threads – Exploitation Platform` findings and
following improvements. It is also advanced with sponsorship from the `U.S. Department of Energy` to support common
API of the |esgf|. The findings are reported on the |ogc-tb14|_ thread, and more
explicitly in the |ogc-tb14-platform-er|_.

The project has been employed for |ogc-tb15-ml|_ to demonstrate the use of Machine Learning interactions with OGC web
standards in the context of natural resources applications. The advancements are reported through the |ogc-tb15-ml-er|_.

Developments are continued in |ogc-tb16|_ to improve methodologies in order to provide better
interoperable geospatial data processing in the areas of Earth Observation Application Packages.
Findings and recommendations are presented in the |ogc-tb16-data-access-proc-er|_.

.. fixme: deploy from ipynb, add |ogc-tb16-ipynb-er| (https://github.com/crim-ca/weaver/issues/63)

Videos and more functionalities were introduced in `Weaver` following |ogc-eo-apps-pilot|_.
Corresponding developments are reported in the |ogc-eo-apps-pilot-er|_.

`Weaver` has been used to participate in interoperability testing effort that lead to |ogc-best-practices-eo-apppkg|_
technical report. This resulted, along with previous efforts, in the definition of |ogc-api-proc-part2| backed by
validated test cases using |cwl| as the representation method for the deployment and execution of |ogc-apppkg|_ close
to the data.

The project is furthermore developed through the *Data Analytics for Canadian Climate Services* (`DACCS`_) initiative.

`Weaver` is implemented in Python with the `Pyramid`_ web framework.
It is part of `PAVICS`_ and `Birdhouse`_ ecosystems and is available within the `birdhouse-deploy`_ server stack.
