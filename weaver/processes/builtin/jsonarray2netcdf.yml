   input:
     description: JSON file formed of an array of file URIs, each representing NetCDF contents.
     # Avoid default schema generated from 'iana:application/json' in CWL.
     # Default produces a simple object with additionalProperties, which is invalid for the expected array of URI.
     # However, we cannot submit the array directly during execution (since it causes an ambiguity with cardinality
     # min/max occurs that are used to represent many files for one input).
