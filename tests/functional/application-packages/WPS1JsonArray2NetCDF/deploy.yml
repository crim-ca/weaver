processDescription:
  process:
    id: WPS1JsonArray2NetCDF
    version: 0.0.1
    description: Process that calls Weaver's own builtin process using its WPS-1 interface.
    # NOTE:
    #   Since the process simply employs the OWS WPS-1 endpoint for builtin 'jsonarray2netcdf' as if it
    #   was a 'remote provider', below inputs and outputs must match exactly the original local process
    #   to allow its execution requirements to be fulfilled when forwarding them.
