Unreleased
==========

Fixes:
------

- Fix a bug where the validation of OneOf items was casting the value to the first valid possibility.
  Now, it doesn't change the value if it's valid without casting it (and still casts it if it's 
  necessary to make it valid).

1.1.0 (2020-02-17)
==================

Changes:
-------------

- Simplify docker image generation and make base/manager/worker variants all available under the same docker
  repo `docker-registry.crim.ca/ogc/weaver <docker-registry.crim.ca/ogc/weaver>`_  with different tags (#5).
- Add *planned future support* of ``Accept-Language`` header for `WPS-1/2` (``geopython/OWSLib 0.20.0``) (#74).
- Improved job logs update with message and progress to allow better tracking of internal operations and/or problems.
- Allow WPS builtin process ``jsonarray2netcdf`` to fetch a remote file.
- Change doc to point to DockerHub `pavics/weaver <https://hub.docker.com/r/pavics/weaver>`_ images.
- Adjust CI rule long-lasting failures until it gets patched by original reference 
  (`gitleaks-actions#3 <https://github.com/eshork/gitleaks-action/issues/3>`_).

Fixes:
-------------

- Fix `readthedocs <https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/pavics-weaver>`_ documentation generation.
- Fix ``.travis`` docker image build condition.
- Fix ``geopython/OWSLib>=0.19.1`` requirement for Python 3.8 support (#62).
- Fix job update filling due to status location incorrectly resolved according to configured PyWPS output path.

1.0.0 (2020-01-28)
==================

New Features:
-------------

- Add ``notification_email`` field to ``Job`` datatype that stores an encrypted email (according to settings) when
  provided in the job submission body (#44).
- Add ability to filter jobs with ``notification_email`` query parameter (#44).
- Add jobs statistics grouping by specific fields using comma-separated list ``groups`` query parameter (#46).
- Add some tests to evaluate new job search methods / grouping results and responses (#44, #46).
- Add handling of multiple `CWL` field ``format`` for ``File`` type.
- Add missing ontology reference support for `CWL` field ``format`` by defaulting to `IANA` namespace.
- Add support for I/O ``array`` of ``enum`` (ie: multiple values of ``AllowedValues`` for a given input) (#30).
- Add support of ``label`` synonym as ``title`` for inputs and process description
  (`CWL` specifying a ``label`` will set it in `WPS` process) (#31)
- Add support of input ``minOccurs`` and ``maxOccurs`` as ``int`` while maintaining ``str`` support (#14).
- Add conformance route with implementation links (#53).
- Add additional landing page link details (#54).
- Add ``weaver.wps_restapi.colander_extras.DropableNoneSchema`` to auto-handle some schema JSON deserialization.
- Add ``weaver.wps_restapi.colander_extras.VariableMappingSchema`` to auto-handle some schema JSON deserialization.
- Add more functional tests (#11, #17).

Changes:
-------------

- Use ``bump2version`` and move all config under ``setup.cfg``.
- Remove enforced ``text/plain`` for `CWL` ``File`` when missing ``format`` field.
- Replace bubbling up of too verbose unhandled exceptions (500 Internal Server Error) by summary message and additional
  internal logging for debugging the cause using an utility exception log decorator.
- Use the same exception log decorator to simplify function definitions when HTTP exceptions are already handled.
- Make ``null`` reference a singleton so that multiple instantiation calls all refer to the same instance and produce
  the expected behaviour of ``<x> is null`` instead of hard-to-identify errors because of english syntax.
- Remove unused function ``weaver.utils.replace_caps_url`` and corresponding tests.
- Remove ``weaver.processes.utils.jsonify_value`` duplicated by ``weaver.processes.wps_package.complex2json``.
- Use more JSON body schema validation using API schema definitions deserialization defined by ``weaver.datatype``.
- Enforce ``builtin`` processes registration on startup to receive applicable updates.
- Provide 2 separate docker images for `Weaver` *manager* and *worker*, corresponding to the `EMS/ADES` API and the
  ``celery`` job runner respectively.
- Update Apache license.

Fixes:
-------------

- Adjust some typing definitions incorrectly specified.
- Fix some failing functionality tests (#11, #17).
- Fix I/O field ordering preserved as specified in payload or loaded reference file.
- Fix setting ``minOccurs=0`` when a ``default`` is specified in the corresponding `CWL` I/O (#17, #25).
- Fix incorrectly overridden ``maxOccurs="unbounded"`` by ``maxOccurs="1"`` when a partial array input definition
  is specified without explicit ``maxOccurs`` in `WPS` payload (#17, #25).
- Fix case where omitted ``format[s]`` in both `CWL` and `WPS` deploy bodies generated a process description with
  complex I/O (file) without required ``formats`` field. Default ``text/plain`` format is now automatically added.
- Fix case where ``format[s]`` lists between `CWL` and `WPS` where incorrectly merged.
- Fix ``metadata`` field within a WPS I/O incorrectly parsed when provided by a WPS-1/2 `XML` process definition.
- Fix invalid JSON response formatting on failing schema validation of process deployment body.
- Fix docker images to support ``pserve`` when using ``gunicorn>=20.x`` dropping support of ``--paste`` config feature.
- Fix multiple Python 2/3 compatibility issues.

0.2.2 (2019-05-31)
==================

- Support notification email subject template.

0.2.1 (2019-05-29)

- Add per-process email notification template.

0.2.0 (2019-03-26)
==================

- Fixes to handle invalid key characters ``"$"`` and ``"."`` during `CWL` package read/write operations to database.
- Fixes some invalid `CWL` package generation from `WPS-1` references.
- More cases handled for `WPS-1` to `CWL` ``WPS1Requirement`` conversion
  (``AllowedValues``, ``Default``, ``SupportedFormats``, ``minOccurs``, ``maxOccurs``).
- Add file format validation to generated `CWL` package from `WPS-1` `MIME-types`.
- Allow auto-deployment of `WPS-REST` processes from `WPS-1` references specified by configuration.
- Add many deployment and execution validation tests for ``WPS1Requirement``.
- Add ``builtin`` application packages support for common operations.
