# List of request URL(s) from which to apply additional options.
#
#   url:
#       URL(s) for which to apply other specified options.
#       Can be any combination of comma/space-delimited single or list of regex string URL.
#       Supported regex rules as defined by: https://pypi.org/project/urlmatch/
#   method:
#       Request method(s) (GET, POST, etc.) to further filter which request should apply the provided options.
#       If not provided, matches any method for the given URL(s). Can be a single or list of case-insensitive string.
#   <option>:
#       Any keyword/value combination supported by 'requests' module and/or function 'weaver.utils.request_extra'.
#       Value of the option must match the expected format (e.g.: bool parameter should be one of true|false).
#       Corresponding options will be applied to the request if it matches the URL(s) regex(es) and optionally method.
#       (e.g.: 'timeout', 'verify', 'retries', etc.)
#
# Notes:
#   1. Options provided in this file are ignored if a corresponding keyword is explicitly specified in the source code.
#   2. Processing will stop at the first match following the sequence order. Ensure patterns are sufficiently explicit.
#
# Although still not great, this specification should be preferred over fully disabling SSL verification
# (i.e.: 'weaver.ssl_verify = false')
# It is recommended to make provided regex(es)/method as restrictive as possible to limit insecure connections.
